# On Task
On Task is a productivity tracking mobile application. Users of this app can create and manage tasks. The app's home page features a calendar component, and each date displays that day's list of user tasks. Users may also edit or delete their tasks, as well as mark them as complete. If users want a history of their productivity, their completed tasks are also available for viewing. 

The frontend of this application uses React Native for it's implementation. While the code is currently more geared towards iOS compatibility, the advantage of React Native is that it is compatible with both Andriod and iOS. So this project can be expanded upon in the future to be available for both systems.

The backend of this application uses Firebase. Firebase's main advantage is that it easily handles many of the backend's functionalities such as user authentication and database management.
